  <h1>HR Productivity Report</h1>
  <p><strong>Employee:</strong> [Employee Name or ID]</p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 09, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Reporting Period:</strong> 17:20 – 18:45 (Approx. 1 hour 25 minutes)</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The collected active window log data indicates a dynamic work session characterized by both sustained focus and frequent task switching.
    Core productivity tools (e.g., command prompt, Copilot, and file management applications) are used extensively—suggesting dedicated work;
    however, numerous entries for “Task Switching” and short-lived window changes imply potential distractions and fragmented focus.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Beneficial Activity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dedicated Work Environments:</strong>
      Use of development tools and coding environments (e.g., Command Prompt and Copilot) shows engagement in core technical work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>File Management Consistency:</strong>
      Frequent use of File Explorer indicates active organization of files and resources.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automated Productivity Tools:</strong>
      Running scripts like <code>automated_screenshot.py</code> and <code>scheduled_recording_script.py</code> demonstrates a proactive approach to process improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sustained Focus:</strong>
      Longer dwell times observed for productivity-related applications point toward episodes of deep work.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Potentially Less Beneficial Activity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Excessive Context Switching:</strong>
      Frequent “Task Switching” entries and short-lived active windows could indicate that the employee is being interrupted or has a fragmented focus.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-Work-Related Interruptions:</strong>
      Occasional appearances of notification or messaging application windows (e.g., WhatsApp) may contribute to distractions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Visualizations</h2>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h3>1. Timeline of Active Windows</h3>
    <p>
      This timeline (Gantt) chart displays each active window session as a colored bar:
      <br>
      - Blue represents core productivity (development and coding tools).
      <br>
      - Green represents file management activities.
      <br>
      - Red indicates task switching or non-core interruptions.

  <div class="section">
    <h3>2. Dwell Time Histogram</h3>
    <p>
      The histogram below shows the duration each window remained active.
      Longer dwell times (e.g., above 1 minute) may indicate deep focus periods,
      while a high frequency of very short dwell times (e.g., under 10 seconds) could suggest distractions.

    <h3>3. Productive vs. Interruptive Activity Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      This pie chart visualizes the overall time distribution between productive activities
      (development tools, file management, etc.) and less productive/interrupted activities (task switching, notifications).

  <h2>Conclusions & Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    Based on the visualizations and activity analysis:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Beneficial Patterns:</strong> The employee consistently leverages core development and file management tools. Automation tools are also employed effectively, indicating a strong work foundation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong> Frequent task switching suggests an opportunity to reduce interruptions. It is recommended to schedule dedicated deep-work blocks and consider strategies to minimize non-work-related notifications.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These insights can serve as the basis for further performance analyses and targeted productivity improvement strategies.
