# Monitoring and Alerting Guide

## Key Metrics Tracked
1. **System Health**
   - CPU/Memory Usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network Latency
   - Service Uptime

2. **Application Metrics**
   - API Response Times
   - Error Rates
   - Request Throughput
   - Queue Lengths

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Active Users
   - Processed Activities
   - Prediction Accuracy
   - Alert Volume

## Alert Configuration
```yaml
# Sample from alert_rules.yml
critical_alerts:
  - name: high_cpu_usage
    condition: cpu_usage > 90%
    duration: 5m
    severity: critical
    notification_channels: [email, slack]

warning_alerts:
  - name: api_latency_increase
    condition: api_latency > 500ms
    duration: 15m
    severity: warning
```

## Dashboard Setup
1. **Grafana Configuration**:
   - Import pre-built dashboards from `/grafana/dashboards`
   - Customize using Prometheus metrics

2. **Key Dashboards**:
   - System Overview
   - API Performance
   - User Activity
   - Prediction Monitoring

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check service logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
2. Verify metrics in Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
3. Review recent deployments
4. Check dependent services

## Maintenance Procedures
- Weekly dashboard reviews
- Monthly alert rule audits
- Quarterly threshold adjustments
